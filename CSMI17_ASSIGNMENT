Q1) % Facts
male(john). % Assume the speaker is John

% Rule to deduce who "that man" is
that_man(X) :-
    father(Y, X),    % X's father is Y
    father(Z, Y),    % Y's father is Z
    father(Z, john), % John’s father is also Z
    john = Y.        % John is Y (since John has no siblings)

% Facts for family relationships
father(john, son). % John is the father of his son

Q2)% Facts about weights
weight(man, 80).
weight(woman, 80).
weight(child1, 30).
weight(child2, 30).

% The boat capacity
boat_capacity(100).

% Initial state: All on the left bank
initial_state([left, left, left, left]). % [Man, Woman, Child1, Child2]

% Final state: All on the right bank
final_state([right, right, right, right]).

% Boat crossings (each time we check the weight)
move([M, W, C1, C2], [M1, W1, C1, C2], [left, B]) :- 
    weight(B, WB), WB =< 100, 
    switch_side(M, M1), 
    B = M. % Man rows alone
move([M, W, C1, C2], [M1, W, C1, C2], [left, B]) :- 
    weight(B, WB), WB =< 100, 
    switch_side(W, W1), 
    B = W. % Woman rows alone

% Check if we can switch sides
switch_side(left, right).
switch_side(right, left).

% Recursive rule to try to transport everyone
cross_river(State, Path) :- 
    final_state(State),
    write(Path), nl.

cross_river(State, Path) :- 
    move(State, NewState, [M, B]),
    cross_river(NewState, [[M, B] | Path]).

% Starting point for solving the problem
solve_crossing :- 
    initial_state(State), 
    cross_river(State, []).
